            <h2>The Office (US)</h2>

               The Office, if you don't already know, was a popular american comedy series which aired in 2005 and ended in 2013 with a total of 203 episodes. It provided a perfect cast, each bringing something else to the show. It kept me and its many fans interested through the perfect blend of comedy and the emotional bonds that fans would create for the characters.

            <h2>Parks and Recreation</h2>

            <p>
               Parks and Rec, just like The Office, has a documentary-like film style, and was a very popular american comedy series. It was originaly intended as a spin off of The Office, which I personally would have greatly enjoyed, but ended up as its own seperate series. It started in 2009, and 125 episodes later, it aired its series finale in 2015.
